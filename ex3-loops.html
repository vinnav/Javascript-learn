/* Exercise 1 - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code
- Loop from 10 down to 0. We've provided you with an initializer — let i = 10;.
- For each iteration, create a new paragraph and append it to the output <div>, which 
we've selected using const output = document.querySelector('.output');. In comments, we've 
provided you with three code lines that need to be used somewhere inside the loop:
    - const para = document.createElement('p'); — creates a new paragraph.
    - output.appendChild(para); — appends the paragraph to the output <div>.
    - para.textContent = — makes the text inside the paragraph equal to whatever you put on the right-hand side.
- Different iteration numbers require different text to be put in the paragraph for that iteration 
(you'll need a conditional statement and multiple para.textContent = lines):
    - If the number is 10, print "Countdown 10" to the paragraph.
    - If the number is 0, print "Blast off!" to the paragraph.
    - For any other number, print just the number to the paragraph.
Remember to include an iterator! However, in this example we are counting down after each iteration, 
not up, so you don't want i++ — how do you iterate downwards?
*/

let output = document.querySelector('.output');
output.innerHTML = '';

let i = 10;


while(i >= 0){
    const para = document.createElement('p'); 
    if(i === 10){
        para.textContent = "Countdown 10";

    } else if(i === 0){
        para.textContent = "Blast off!";
    } else {
        para.textContent = i;
    }

    output.appendChild(para);
    
    i--;
}

/* Exercise 2 - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code
- Filling in a guest list

- Write a loop that will iterate from 0 to the length of the people array. 
You'll need to start with an initializer of  let i = 0;, but what exit condition do you need?
- During each loop iteration, check if the current array item is equal to "Phil" or "Lola" 
using a conditional statement:
    - If it is, concatenate the array item to the end of the refused paragraph's textContent, 
    followed by a comma and a space.
    - If it isn't, concatenate the array item to the end of the admitted paragraph's textContent, 
    followed by a comma and a space.
*/

const people = ['Chris', 'Anne', 'Colin', 'Terri', 'Phil', 'Lola', 'Sam', 'Kay', 'Bruce'];
    
const admitted = document.querySelector('.admitted');
const refused = document.querySelector('.refused');
admitted.textContent = 'Admit: ';
refused.textContent = 'Refuse: '

let i = 0;

while (i < people.length){
    if (people[i] == "Phil" || people[i] == "Lola"){
        refused.textContent += people[i] + ", ";
    } else {
        admitted.textContent += people[i] + ", ";
    }
    i++;
}

refused.textContent = refused.textContent.slice(0,refused.textContent.length-2) + '.';
admitted.textContent = admitted.textContent.slice(0,admitted.textContent.length-2) + '.';

/* Exercise 3 - Javascript.info - http://javascript.info/while-for

What is the last value alerted by this code? Why?

let i = 3;
while (i) {
  alert( i-- );
}

last value is 1, while(i) stops when i = 0;
*/

/* Exercise 4 - Javascript.info - http://javascript.info/while-for

For every loop iteration, write down which value it outputs and then compare it with the solution.
Both loops alert the same values, or not?

- The prefix form ++i:
let i = 0;
while (++i < 5) alert( i );

- The postfix form i++
let i = 0;
while (i++ < 5) alert( i );

prefix: 1, 2, 3, 4;
postfix: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5;
*/

/* Exercise 5 - Javascript.info - http://javascript.info/while-for

For each loop write down which values it is going to show. Then compare with the answer.
Both loops alert same values or not?

- The postfix form:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );

- The prefix form:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );

postfix: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4;
prefix: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4;

/* Exercise 6 - Javascript.info - http://javascript.info/while-for
Use the for loop to output even numbers from 2 to 10. */

for(let i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
    if(i%2 == 0){
        alert(i);
    }
}
/* Exercise 7 - Javascript.info - http://javascript.info/while-for
Rewrite the code changing the for loop to while without altering its behavior (the output should stay same).

 for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  alert( `number ${i}!` );
}
*/

let i = 0;
while(i < 3){
    alert( `number ${i}!` );
    i++;
}

/* Exercise 8 - Javascript.info - http://javascript.info/while-for
Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – 
ask them to input again.

The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels 
the input/enters an empty line.
*/

while(true){
    let x = prompt("input number greater than 100:");
    if (x > 100){
        alert("nice");
        break;
    } else if (x = null){
        break;
        } else {
        alert("Not greater than 100, input again:");
        continue;
    }
    
/* Exercise 9 - Javascript.info - http://javascript.info/while-for
n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.

Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.

For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
*/

let n = prompt("insert prime number");

nextPrime:
for(i = 2; i <= n; i++){
    for(j = 2; j < i; j++){
       if(i%j == 0){
        continue nextPrime;
    }
    alert(i);
}
}
